Using data analytics tools like Pandas and Seaborn, we explore rating discrepancies across popular titles to assess whether Fandango's scores are consistently higherâ€”and what that means for users and stakeholders.

From a Data Analytics point of view, skewed data can lead to incorrect insights and consequently wrong data-driven decisions. But from a ML point of view, skewed data can mdecrease accuracy and mess up predictions with no obvious reason at first glance.

Datasets sourced from public movie ratings were normalized and aligned for accurate comparisons using Pandas, and then Seaborn to bring clarity to the rating distributions, enabling stakeholders to quickly interpret the trends.
