"Can you trust movie ratings if the website also sells tickets? - A look into the 2015 Fandango Controversy"

Project Subject is from Capstone Exercise for Udemy course "Python for Machine Learning and Data Science Masterclass" (https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-machine-learning-data-science-masterclass/) that I undertook as a means of revision and extra practice to supplement my Data Science Professional Diploma from Big Blue Data Academy.


I got some ideas regarding which graphs to show from the course but all the code is written by me and is independent from the course. This Notebook is uploaded to showcase my code-writing style and skills.
